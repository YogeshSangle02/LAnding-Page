        <h1>About Us</h1>
    </div>



    <div class="about-text2">
        <p>Humanity has always turned to excellence as a flower turns towards the sun.
            Quality thus perceived, is an abiding interest in, and a desire to develop, whatever is regarded as
            excellent in Arts, scholarly pursuits of Sciences, Engineering, Technology, and Humanities.
            The need to educate and train young men and women, to hone them into professionally competent, rounded
            personalities has been our burning passion.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was Richard Mulcaster of Elizabethan England who declared: “It is not a mind, not a body that we have to
            cultivate, but a man, and we cannot divide him”.
            SASTRA is committed to excellence with a holistic approach and has consistently maintained the highest
            standards in "a man-making education" in the immortal words of Swami Vivekananda,
            which can only be ensured by quality teaching of the finest calibre.
            <br>
            <br>
            We here in SASTRA believe in Tagorean concept of "The Home and the World", keeping in mind, the vital
            importance of empowering women, by giving them their rightful place in national development.

            We also believe in the motto 'urbi et orbi' – the city and the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the earth is fast becoming a global village with amazing technological advances, transcending national
            barriers, our educational goals are geared towards nation-building on the one hand and our involvement in
            the process of globalization on the other.

            SASTRA has carved a niche for itself as a Centre for fostering and developing the body, mind and spirit of
            its students.
            <br>
            <br>
            SASTRA is totally committed to this three – fold flowering of the students entrusted to its care.
            Our blend of academic excellence and real world experience with moral values has earned SASTRA, National
            recognition.
            <br>
            <br>

            SASTRA earnestly endeavours to be among the best and utilizes opportunities for the overall improvement of
            higher education, training, and research & development. With a strong and deep commitment and a genuine
            desire to fulfil the aspirations of a growing, fast-developing society, SASTRA has been contributing
            significantly towards the realization of the National goal of envisioning India 2020.
